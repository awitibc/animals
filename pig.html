            Domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) may have initially been domesticated in the Tigris basin 
            from their ancestors, the wild boars. The time of domestication has been traced to 9000 BCE but 
            remnants excavated in Cyprus point to an even earlier period of domestication. The domestication 
            process of pigs has been found to be a very complex procedure that involved the cross-exchange between 
            domesticated pigs in Near East, wild boars of Europe, and Asian pigs. The study has supported this complex
             domestication and cross-breeding.

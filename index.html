        <h1>about animals</h1>
        <p>Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia.
             With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce 
             sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, 
             the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have 
             been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 
             7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 
             metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming 
             intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.
        
            Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body 
            plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes—in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as
             nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs—and the deuterostomes, containing both the echinoderms as well 
             as the chordates, the latter containing the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals 
             were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became 
             clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which 
             began around 542 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been 
             identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.
            
            Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without.
             Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in
              1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809.
               In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa 
               (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer
                considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies 
                on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at 
                demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.
            
            Humans make use of many other animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), 
            for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. 
            Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals
             were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are 
             featured in mythology and religion.</p>

        <h2>Which were the first animals to be domesticated?</h2>
         <p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are considered the first animals to be domesticated in history.
              Domestication is believed to have first occurred around 13,000 BCE. The closest relatives to dogs
               are the grey wolves, and their common ancestor is believed to be the extinct Pleistocene 
               population of grey wolf specifically. The initial domestication took place in 
               Europe according to the existing archaeological evidence. During this era, as 
               the primary activity of humans was hunting and gathering, it is theorized that dogs
                may have been used to assist in hunting. Many phylogenetic changes have occurred to 
                dogs since the time of domestication which has resulted in significant physical and 
                behavioral changes.

        <p>
            The most likely original ancestor of the domesticated goat 
            (Capra aegagrus hircus) is Bezoar ibex of the Zagros Mountains which was domesticated 
            approximately 10,000 BCE. The archaeological evidence of the first goat domestication has been 
            traced to Ganj Darej in Iran, but this is not the only site where archaeological remnants have 
            been found. Goats are believed to have been domesticated by Neolithic farmers who herded them 
            for milk, meat, and clothing. Domestication has resulted in changes in physical appearance
             and the behavior of goats. Goats are members of the family Bovidae, and currently, there are 
             over 300 distinct species of goats throughout the world. Different species of goats survive 
             in a different set of environment depending on their evolutionary adaptations.

        <h3> Sheep (Ovis Aries)</h3>
        <p>
          
           Sheep (Ovis aries) origin can be traced to their ancestors the mouflon of Europe 
           (Ovis mouflon). The history of sheep domestication dates back to around 9000 BCE and archaeological
            evidence points to Mesopot amia as the original place of domestication. Sheep were reared for the 
            supply of meat, milk, and skin but later in Western Europe and Southwest Asia, they were reared for
             secondary products such as wool. The domesticated sheep display different features as compared 
             to their relatives and have developed to depend solely on humans for feeding and management.
